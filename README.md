# Ken's Bio

## About Me :skull_and_crossbones:
_My name is Ken Harman. I am a jack of all trades and still figuring out which one to master! I am a father of two beautiful kids. I enjoy spending as much time with my kids as possible. I've lived all over the US. Currently I reside in Seattle, WA. Looking forward to starting a new journey in the Tech industry once I graduate from the Code Fellows bootcamp!_ Check out my link: https://kharman82.github.io/learning-journal.com

-  Always aim for the Moon, that way I can always achieve my goals!
