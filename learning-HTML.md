**Wireframe**  

A Wireframe is just a simple sketch of the key information that you are planning to put on each page of your site. It should also show the breakdown of importance or chain of command. In a nutshell; its the rough draft markup of what you want it to look like structurally speaking.

**Visualization is Key!**  

Visualization is also key to having a successful site. Layout of your img/ pic is important. The way your text wraps around the dedicated sections is important. No one wants to leave your site confused or sick because they had a tough time following the content. Sometimes simplicity is key!
