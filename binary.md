# Binary Code!

**_After watching the 6 videos on the tube I learned the following:_**

**Input , storage ,processing, output**

_I learned how these things work together in order to make the
modern day computers work. It went through the history of how 
older machines worked off of the Binary language. Matter of fact, 
computers still use this language to this day . However computers
are bigger, faster and smarter!_      


**binary & data**   
_The binary number system:_

**binary & data**

_0 and 1 and electrical signals is what makes up a circuit!
sound and pictures / pixels with binary_

_Input and output are information!
complex circuits with electricity running through little wires
sending signals with 1's and 0's._ 

_Hardware and software interacting with each other.
CPU - master chip that controls all the other parts 
of the computer._

**Operating system:**

_controls other software in the computer. Bill Gates created what
we know as Windows today!_

_All in all, binary code still to this day is what makes the computer world go round!_
